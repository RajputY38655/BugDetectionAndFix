Project Overview

The primary objective of this project is to develop:

• an automated pipeline that utilizes deep learning and generative AI models
to identify functional bugs in software code and provide recommended fixes.  
• the system aims to enhance software quality, reduce debugging time, and
improve developer productivity by integrating seamlessly into the software
development lifecycle.

Background

• Functional bugs in software can lead to incorrect program behavior,
security vulnerabilities, and system crashes, which can be costly and
time-consuming to resolve.  
• Traditional methods of bug detection and fixing often rely on manual
code reviews and testing, which are labor-intensive and prone to
human error.  
• Recent advancements in deep learning and generative AI offer
promising opportunities to automate these processes by learning
from vast amounts of code data and generating intelligent insights.  

Key Component -   

Data Pipeline  

Source Identification:  
Identify diverse sources of code
data, such as open-source
repositories (e.g., GitHub) &
public datasets specifically
curated for bug detection and
fixing.  
Data Preprocessing:  
Normalization, Tokenization,
Language Handling, etc.
Data Storage & Augmentation:
Database setup, Data organization,
etc.  
Data Pipeline Automation:  
Implement an ETL process to
automate data collection,
preprocessing, and storage.
